THIS IS THE DOCUMENTATION OF INTERPRETER

THE HYPOTHETICAL LANGUAGE IS CALLED "UP"

Here is an example of code written in UP language:

number x
number y
assign 1 to y
read x
as long as x > 1
	assign x * y to y
	assign x - 1 to x

This is the implementation of the factorial problem.
The program reads the input from console,
executes its factorial, the outputs on console.

There are 8 data types in the UP language:
1. number (stores integral and floating point numbers)
2. symbol (stores characters)
3. bool (stores boolean values)
4. line (stores strings)

5. ->number (pointer to number)
6. ->symbol (pointer to symbol)
7. ->bool (pointer to bool)
8. ->line (pointer to line)

the program reads the content from a file which MUST have
.up extension. then it separates the code into execution blocks.

There are 3 types of execution blocks in the UP language:

1. SYMPLE: commands, which do not have any scope
2. CONDITIONAL: commands in the body of "if" and the conditional expression
3. ITERATIVE: command in the body of "as long as" and the iterative expression

Then each block is executed as a sequence of commands.
By the way, execution flow differs in blocks:
SIMPLE blocks are executed once
CONDITIONAL blocks are executed once and only if the result of the conditional expression is evaluated to true
ITERATIVE blocks are executed as long as the iterative conditional expression is evaluated to true

The commands situated in CONDITIONAL and ITERATIVE blocks must start after a HORIZONTAL TAB

At the moment the program of iterator is incomplete but it is a promising project to look forward...!!!  :)
